## Bug: "Show Code" feature in Docs page fails for story files in folders starting with numbers or containing hyphens

### Description
Story files (`*.stories.razor`) located in folders that start with numbers or contain certain symbols (like hyphens) do not display their source code when using the "Show Code" feature in the Docs page. The feature works correctly for stories in folders with standard naming conventions.

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Create a Blazing Story project
2. Place a `*.stories.razor` file in a folder that starts with a number (e.g., `123Examples/`)
3. Or place a `*.stories.razor` file in a folder containing hyphens (e.g., `Some-Folder/`)
4. Navigate to the Docs page for that component
5. Click "Show Code" for any story
6. **Expected**: The source code should be displayed
7. **Actual**: No source code is shown (empty content)

### Example Folder Structures That Cause Issues
- `123Examples/Button.stories.razor`
- `9Test/Rating.stories.razor` 
- `Some-Folder/Button.stories.razor`
- `UI-Components/Button.stories.razor`
- `123-Test/UI-Components/Button.stories.razor`

### Root Cause
The issue occurs because of a mismatch between how embedded resource names are generated by the .NET build system and how `StoriesRazorSource.GetSourceCodeAsync()` attempts to locate them:

1. **Navigation paths** are normalized using `NavigationPath.Create()` which converts special characters to dashes
2. **Resource lookup** uses simple string concatenation to build resource names from file paths
3. **.NET embedded resource naming** follows specific conventions:
   - Folder names starting with numbers are prefixed with underscore (`123Examples` → `_123Examples`)
   - Special characters like hyphens are converted to underscores (`Some-Folder` → `Some_Folder`)

When the calculated resource name doesn't match the actual embedded resource name, `GetManifestResourceStream()` returns null, resulting in empty source code display.

### Environment
- **Blazing Story Version**: [Current main branch]
- **Framework**: .NET 8.0/9.0
- **Project Type**: Both Blazor Server and Blazor WebAssembly affected

### Impact
- **Severity**: Medium - Feature is completely broken for affected folder structures
- **Scope**: Affects any project using non-standard folder naming conventions
- **Workaround**: Rename folders to avoid numbers at start and special characters (but this may not be desirable for project organization)

### Additional Context
This affects the core "Show Code" functionality which is an important feature for documentation and component exploration. Projects that organize their components using numbered folders (like "01-Basic", "02-Advanced") or hyphenated names (like "UI-Components", "Form-Controls") are particularly impacted.

The issue is specifically in the `StoriesRazorSource.GetSourceCodeAsync()` method where resource name generation doesn't follow .NET's embedded resource naming conventions.
